This is a password manager that uses 7-zip and an external usb drive to save passwords 

## Installation and Useage:
* Download 7-zip console version plugin for Far Manager and place in working directory [7-zip]
 * you may want to install normal 7-zip for windows as well, because the plugin is in a 7z archive.

* Install [AutoHotKey] v 1.1.33.1 or higher

* Set up usb drive to use drive letter Z:/ or change the working directory.

* Create key_Card.7z archive with both .morlock files inside, and place them on the drive with a master-password.

* When using morlock-pass by default your master-password is forgotten after every action. If you don't like that, it can be changed in the GUI.
